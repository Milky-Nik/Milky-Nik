 <summary><h3>🌱 About me</h3></summary>
I'm a first year student in WSB Merito University in Poland, where I am studying Programming in C#, but also Administration and operation of computer systems, peripherals and local computer networks, creation and administration of websites, internet applications and databases. I started coding and building projects with Unity Game Engine in 2020 with tutorials about how to make a game. Furthermore, I made my first game and wasn't satisfied, but was excited to start over, try new things, follow tutorials and making more new things, animations, drawing, UI and, of course, programming algorithms. I wanted to learn more and graduated from the C# course, where I learn about .NET and a lot of useful programming knowledge.
Now i am switched to Godot Game Engine where i using C# and learning game development even further!
